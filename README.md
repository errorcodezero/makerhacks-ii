# Makerhacks II

Open Prototype Theme: Something that restores equilibrium after being pushed by the world - Balance despite pushing

## Ideas

- Ball balancing robot using computer vision, servos, and a powerful microcontroller
- Game with gyroscope that's a ball in a maze dodging holes(on screen)
- Game with actual ball and maze with servo motors to tilt the maze and move the ball
- Clients which are able to talk to each other but each person has to send a message. You can't send multiple messages in a row since you need to wait for everyone to respond.
